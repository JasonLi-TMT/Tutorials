       " \"Oy vey, do I bother exercising my fingers to type this review since there's already 10K+ and it's an institution to all.... well here I go anyway:Was over the moon excited to try this classic spot, referenced in movies & tv shows galore. I'm a Jew, so the bar is set high when it comes to classic delicatessen. Katz was a disappointment to say the least. Very thickly sliced meats... I think it's safe to say most who eat sandwiches prefer it on the thinly sliced side. They used a butcher knife, no slicing machine in sight. I respect that. I ordered pastrami on rye with mustard and coleslaw. I have had MUCH tastier, saltier pastrami...for example Carnegie Deli (RIP) and the best, Harold's in NJ. Was a bit on the fatty side. Bread was not fresh, granted it was late. Matzo ball soup wasn't half bad--tasty broth, fluffy ball...obviously still not Grandma's. Half sour & sour pickles provided, no complaints. Decent sized portions but pretty dang pricy.Overall, the service at Katz was very rude (you say typical NYC charm, but I beg to differ). It's cafeteria order style late night, you get a ticket. To pay by credit card it is all the way in the back, cash up front only. Wall bombarded with celebrity photos who have visited. Old, dingy charm interior maintained. An OK meal, especially to those who don't eat Jew food often...but I personally would not make the trek to the village again for it.\",\n",
       " \"Everybody says that a trip to NY is not completed without a sandwich from Katz's. I dropped by the place in the morning of my last day. The place was lightly populated. There were many cutter stations, sandwiches in the front and bagels at the back, so I doubt there can be a long wait even during a busy time. Of course, I opted for the Pastrami Sandwich. Haven't had many Pastrami Sandwich, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. The ones that I've had were dry and hard to swallow. With the stacks of meat that were piled between the thin slices of bread and mustard, I expected Katz's Pastrami Sandwich to be the same. But, I couldn't be more wrong. The moment I tried to pick up the humongous sandwich, everything started to fall apart; everything was surprisingly soft. Even the bread was softer than I expected. Each slice of pastrami was accompanied with a good amount of fat that made the whole pile melt-in-the-mouth tender. Although the sandwich was big, it was easy to get a mouthful of everything. The pastrami tasted fresh, succulent, and not salty at all. Katz's Pastrami Sandwich gave me a Pastrami experience that I've never had before.The fresh and pickled cucumbers cut the meaty, fatty sandwich well. I also enjoyed ketchup on the sandwich. Despite its high quality, the sandwich was still a litte too pricey, in my opinion.By the end, I was completely and happily stuffed with one sandwich; I would recommend splitting between 2. I can concur that this is a must-visit classics spot for visitors of NYC.\",\n",
       " \"Whenever you're in NYC, one of the iconic food spots to visit is Katz. The place is always busy and the portion sizes are definitely worth the price. I ordered the pastrami hot sandwich and thank goodness I was able to share the sandwich with my wife. The sandwich was enormous!Each bite was full of flavor with each piece of meat being juicy and savory. There's nothing I can't stand more than a dry sandwich and this is anything but that. The experience was completed by washing it all down with Dr. Brown Cream Soda. The place might be a little too touristy for some, but the food is worth it in my opinion. Can't wait to go back and try the other sandwiches!\",\n",
       " \"So, I had zero interest in eating here on our honeymoon last October but Heather insisted. I just assumed this was an overrated tourist trap that happened to be featured in some movie I have never (nor ever will) see. But heather had ate here a few years back and raved about it, so being a good husband I obliged.We walked down from our condo in Midtown and I was further less impressed seeing the mass of humanity lined up down the street to get in (I really hate line ups). After a long wait in line outside we were given a ticket to join the cattle call inside, literally shoulder to shoulder people. I almost choked when I looked at the sandwich board and saw the pricing on sandwiches... all over $20 each. At that point I wished we had decided to dine anywhere but here.What this ended up being was the best damn meal we had on our New York adventure. Oh my lord, was I wrong. There is a reason people line up for this and pay crazy prices. As soon as I saw the first sandwiches being passed over the counter I knew I was wrong on my preconceived notions of this place. HUGE sandwiches stacked with delicious smelling meat that is pickled/ cured/ carved in house. \\xa0 We were very hungry and decided to tame our ordering a bit... we ordered a half corned beef, a full Reuben, a matzo ball soup and a side of pickles. I don't even know where to start on what was best... everything in front of us was incredible. We could not finish everything in front of us, try as I might.I would wait in this line up in a heartbeat in the future. Incredible.\",\n",
       " \"Katz's is probably the most famous deli in New York, if not the world.I've lived five minutes from here for almost three years but my first visit was last weekend. Somehow my desire for meat and willigness to wait in line never quite dovetail. But around 11 am on a Sunday the lines were mild and my boyfriend and I decided it was the day.Katz's is chaotic in a way it doesn't need to be. Confusingly, there's a small section for table service. There are at least three places to queue for food, though I believe only two of those serve sandwiches. The lines are self-forming and unpoliced, which leads to a lot of cutting.It took us maybe 20 minutes to get our sandwich, and that was with a negligible line compared to the hordes coming in when we left. Service is rushed and indifferent. Tables aren't very clean and if you get soup there'll be about as much on the plate as in the bowl.So, why go?The pastrami is truly all that. Thick cut, mildly smoky, moist, reminiscent of a pleasantly fatty brisket. Excellent. All it needs is that nice sharp mustard and a few bites of pickle. Absolutely worth the $22 split between two people.We also had a chocolate egg cream (unknown, at least $5) and matzoh ball soup ($8). The former is a great example, a bit creamier than typical. The latter is mostly broth and ball, but both are solid. It's massive so split this as well.After tax and tip, this somehow added up to $60. They're cash only and you pay with your ticket on the way out.Overall, the experience is stressful but it's worth doing at least once. I may look into delivery to get that meat without the hassle, but I know I'll be going back for it.\",\n",
       " \"Is it chaos? YESIs there a wait? YESIs it expensive? YES Is it worth it tho..? YESSSSSSSSSSSS Honestly, if its your first time please please try the pastrami.. i mean its what they're KNOWN for.. don't get me wrong.. I'm sure all the other sandwiches/items are good but its the same thing as going to a 5 star steak restaurant known for their dry aged steaks and ordering chicken.. i mean.. dont you want to rate the food on what they're good at and the reason why everybody is lining up for?! They offer the other menu items probably as a side so other people who don't like pastrami can have some bomb food but seriously tho.. COME ON. Maybe i'm being a little mean but if you get food.. it would make some sort of sense to you. I come from the home of Langers in Los Angeles.. which is OUR version of Katz (but i think Langers is better by a TAD (: ). Like all the other reviews.. get the REUBEN! You can easily share it so you don't get stuffed till you can't move! The main reason why I took off one star was bc of the overall cleanliness of the restaurant. They try to clean as much as possible which I get.. its crazy in there.. the space is SMALL. However, the floors are dirty and when we went the vents were leaking!! So it felt like getting rained on by dirty water :( . I didn't let that ruin my experience but it was definitely worth taking one star off.My boyfriend was a happy camper and it is definitely a place we would go back when we visit. We kind of like the chaos feel... feels very new york.\",\n",
       " \"WOW, this place is incredible. Is it a little pricey.....yes, but in my eyes, it's worth it. I've enjoyed it sober, I've enjoyed it drunk, but to truly appreciate all the flavor, you should eat while sober. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and the corned beef. The chicken salad sandwich was MASSIVE. I'm very picky about my chicken salad and this exceeded expectations. The sandwich had the perfect ratio of white chicken meat to mayo to celery. It was truly the perfect bite.Corned beef was also phenomenal. It had a tender, melt-in-your-mouth texture. The fat was still on it and just added to the deliciousness. I can't say enough great things about Katz's. I just wish I lived near it so I can experience it more. PRO TIP: You can ask for half sandwiches! If you're craving a couple of things, you can have your cake and eat it too.\",\n",
       " \"Have lived in New York for 5 years, and somehow never went into Katz's - probably always dissuaded by the chaos/lines. Go when its raining to avoid mayhem.Pastrami reuben. That's all you need to know.\",\n",
       " \"5 stars because hands down it's the best pastrami you will ever have. If you've never been please visit. You don't go for the service it is for the sheer love of the food. The steak fries, the pastrami, the hot dogs, the mustard, the rye bread, the pickles...oh I could go on!!!Be prepared to wait in line if it is the weekend and have people hover over you while you eat and they wait for a table. If you're local and just want the best pastrami and don't live close to Harold's which is a distant second go late at night to avoid the crowds and lines and just deal with those visiting after partying. They are now up to $23 for pastrami on rye and yes it's worth every red cent!\",\n",
       " \"Listen, this is very simple..:: if you don't mind spending $30 on a pastrami and Coke. Then we can talk. Don't try anything else... you will not be able to finish your sandwich! And people, I've tried many other things here .... just stay stay with the \\xa0pastrami, it is the best sandwich there ... period! Walk in grab a number, walk to the slicing station and ask for pastrami! It will be sliced in front of you and piled high! Take your sandwich and your drink sit in a table with pickles... yes they are a must... and don't be tempted by anything else. Once you have finished what you can eat, you can carry the rest to the last counter where they will wrap it for you. They are always wrapping, so don't be shy about it.Ps. Don't loose that little ticket that what you have to hand to the cashier in your way out to pay! :-)\",\n",
       " \"What else is there to be said?Everything here other than the pastrami is pretty average--but that pastrami is to die for. Soooo tasty and flavorful and just keeps you coming back for more. This is definitely a must visit in any trip to NYC, though don't go during rush hour to avoid massive lines.Egg cream was decent, but nothing special.Matzoh ball soup was decent, but nothing special.Knish was just not very good.Overall, come here and get the pastrami--it's worth the trip.\",\n",
       " 'One of the iconic deli restaurant in NYC since 1888. Upon entering the restaurant, you would receive a red ticket. We ordered pastrami, corn beef, potato Latke and matzo ball soup. Everything was good and we especially loved the pastrami sandwich, which had a combination of lean and fat meat. The pastrami was tender, fresh, savory, moist and enjoyable delicious. Corn beef was a little bit dry, but it was still good. I highly recommend to get the pastrami instead of the corn beef. The sandwiches were good size and it came along with pickles. There are lots of tables in the back near the bathroom. It is a little expensive and one sandwich costs about 24 dollars, but it is worth. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. It is great spot to get pastrami sandwich.',\n",
       " 'Katz\\'s deli - since 1888. And mostly unchanged since my childhood visits. So the line was a full block long! Fortunately, the weather was terrific for a mid-winter day, and we had a nice time chatting with those on line with us.When you enter, you get a ticket - and you cannot leave without one, so be careful! Your food and drink costs are handwritten on your ticket by the \"Cutter\" and drink station folks, and you can pay cash at the exit or credit in the back. Everything moves fairly quickly, so we were sitting down within 45 minutes of our arrival at the end of the line. Once in you head to your random \"Cutter\" sandwich station (seven choices) or to the hot dog/burger/knish/latke line, unless you want table service- on this day an estimated 1/2 hour wait.This was a first for my wife, so the wait was worth it for me to watch her sample the fresh sliced pastrami Cutter #5 placed on the counter as he prepared our pastrami on rye ($22.45), along with a generous helping of kosher dill pickles and a monstrous mound of cole slaw ($1.00). The oh my god was expected...We moved on from the sandwich line to open seating grabbing a black cherry and a coke on the way ($5.90) In summary the sandwich was magnificent- the best pastrami sandwich on earth, IMHO. Tipping your cutter is customary...so figure $75 all in for two at this venerable NYC deli. Put it on your bucket list.',\n",
       " \"I personally do not rally like this kind if sandwich, but I would have to say that it is a good place for late night food and hanging out with a group of friends. We went after 10:00pm, and it was still crowded that it took around 20 mins to us to finish ordering. The good thing is that we did not need to wait in the line outside. Note: *Make sure you keep your ticket because that's how you order and pay and leave the door. *Table is available for self server. *Water is available at the very back.\",\n",
       " \"I was excited to come here because of its popularity. It's cafeteria style so you enter and someone hands you a green ticket. Hold onto your ticket because if you lose it it's a $50 fee.In my opinion it was very unorganized. Different workers were telling us different things about where to stand and how to order so it took us a second to finally order. The cutter was very friendly and lets you try a piece of meat before making your sandwich. I ordered a corn beef sandwich on a hero and we also ordered pastrami sandwiches, carrot cake, bread pudding, and fries. The pastrami was the best! The corned beef I just thought was okay. I loved the desserts as well. They have a huge walk for tap water in the back.The main reason for my 4 stars is the price. It's about $22 for a sandwich which kind of shocked me. Overall I would come back though and order the pastrami again. Definitely the best pastrami sandwich I've tasted!\",\n",
       " \"Food: the pastrami was insanely yummy, not hard (corn beef was kinda chewy) but melts perfectly into your mouth with so much flavor.The portion is huge though, so even though I ordered half a sandwich, I could not handle all that meat. Was enough meat for like 4 sandwiches. The matzo ball was decent, tasted like flour. Prob would not get that again. Service: it was interesting, you walk in they give you a ticket. You go to where the cutters are, where they will give u sample and also make the sandwich for you. After you get your food, you sit down, finish, and THEN you pay with the ticket they gave you in the beginning. It was def an experience for me.I went on a Saturday 9:45am so there wasn't much of a wait which is why I went to try.Price was about $23 for half the sandwich and the soup. There are plenty of seats.\",\n",
       " \"Had to give this place a try after seeing all the videos and people mentioning Katz.Was not disappointed at all.Came here around 9pm on a weekday (Christmas week) and the queue was not long at all (Probably got lucky).I would have to say it was the best pastrami I've ever had.

Pretty close to the best in the city (shout out to Fette Sau in Williamsburg but they only have it periodically) - certainly among the best on the planet. \\xa0How do they get the Pastrami so moist but not have the rye bread get soaked? \\xa0Mad skills these people have!\",\n",
       " \"Best pastrami I've ever had hands down. That alone deserves the 5 stars.Skip the corned beef though. \\xa0My bf and I ordered it to try and it was just.... the most briney fishy thing ever. Maybe we just don't know corned beef but it's nothing like we've ever had.. in a bad way. But again, maybe we just don't know corned beef.\",\n",
       " \"I'll just add to the rest of the 10,000+ reviews and say I have been visiting NYC for over 20 years and felt this was just another tourist trap. It's not. Do yourself a favor, embrace the line, come hungry and taste one of the best pieces of meat you'll ever have in your life. My 1/2 matza ball soup and 1/2 hot pastrami sandwich was one of the best $20 meals I ever had. I can't begin to describe the taste of this meat other than its just an essential experience everyone must undertake. 1 star docked for cleanliness. Understand its busy, there are a ton of people traveling in and out, but after braving lines and perhaps long commutes to try the famous Katz, I would love to eat my food with clean floors, clean tables, and clean silverware.\",\n",

I'll just add to the rest of the reviews and I felt this was just another tourist trap. It's not. Do yourself a favor, embrace the line and you will get to taste one of the best pieces of meat you'll ever have in your life. My husband and I would up there at like 2 am. There was a short line when we got there, and we got a ticket at the door. The guy who cut my meat was very nice and answered all of my questions about the menu thoroughly and without judgement and I really appreciated it. The meat was well seasoned and cooked perfectly. It melts in your mouth. It was so big that is a great to split and both of us were full. We will be back on our next visit to NYC.\",\n",
       " 'I was crazy overwhelmed the second I walked into this place. I had no idea of the rules or the way that Katz\\'s is run so I was just confused. I\\'m still not sure how it works.We got in line at a \"cutter\" but let\\'s be real - it is chaos, people running into me, trying to cut in line, etc. You kind of have to shove other people to get to the front of the counter.For some odd reason that I still don\\'t know the answer to, is that the \"cutters\" give you slices of the meat to try first before they make your sandwich. I\\'m ordering the sandwich anyway, why do I need to try some slices ahead of time and just get full off of those? But we had a corned beef sandwich and a pastrami sandwich. I hated the corned beef but the pastrami was very good, it melted in your mouth. WAY too much mustard on the sandwiches though. I also don\\'t like pickles but we tried the pickles it came with and hated them both.My biggest problem here besides the complete madhouse inside, is how freakin\\' expensive the sandwiches are here! We only got 2 sandwiches and paid more than FORTY DOLLARS. How ridiculous. The sandwiches are overFLOWING with meat, so much that a human could not eat an entire sandwich. So if you just give us a normal amount of meat, you don\\'t have to charge $25 a sandwich.Overall, the pastrami sandwich was good but it\\'s certainly not worth the price.',\n",
       " 'I\\'ll admit, I watched Youtube tutorial before I even set foot in this joint and I still made a faux-pas (I went to the beverage line to order a chocolate egg cream when you\\'re supposed to order them in the grill line). But, the staff couldn\\'t have been more courteous, I don\\'t know why they get a bad wrap, and I just took it in stride. It was my first time having an egg cream. First time having a knish. First time having proper pastrami, it was so rich! I started to pick at the tender and highly seasoned meat and before I knew it, I was full! I hadn\\'t even gotten to the bread. This isn\\'t that no-nitrate Columbus deli roll stuff, this is highly seasoned, medium rare pink, crunchy bark and perfectly fatty brisket. Sliced just thin enough. Heavy on the mustard. I thought the knish would be ultra doughy, but the exterior was a crispy shell hiding mashed potatoes inside. The chocolate egg cream was good, like a carbonated chocolate milk, but it was lukewarm and needed ice!I ate in the back section where the staff were taking their bread (is that cornmeal on the floor?) and as I was packing up my sandwich in some parchment from my tray, two people asked me, \"you want a bag, love?\" And they brought me one. So nice. When I bought a t-shirt for my mom, I used my credit card. They gave me the shirt, I went back to the beverages line and paid and then left.Everyone says Katz a really touristy thing to do, but the thing is...is there another place like Katz left anywhere else? Jake Dell is doing a great job at being the umpteenth (in reality I think it\\'s 4) generation to keep this going!',\n",
       " \"So we used to like to visit the Carnegie Deli when in New York, but after that closed someone told us about Katz's, and it did not disappoint.Here is what we noticed:- We arrived around 10:30am and were handed a ticket...it wasn't very clear how things worked, but we wanted a sit-down lunch and so we were directed to one of the tables along the wall. \\xa0Just be sure to bring back all of the tickets you receive to the register when leaving, or apparently you get charged for lost tickets.- Service was ok...it took our waiter a little bit of time to show up and he was a little crusty as first, but he warmed up over time. \\xa0(Note, he made it clear that we should leave the tip in cash on the table versus putting it in the jar up front).- The foot was great. \\xa0Coffee was better than expected. \\xa0We got one pastrami sandwich and the bagel and lox platter. \\xa0They were out of sesame seed bagels, but the poppy seed one was pretty good.Bottom line: \\xa0Worth a visit, but try to go at a time where you can avoid the crowds!\",\n",
       " \"Love how they keep it old school here. It's famous for a reason and if it's not broke, don't fix it. The only confusing part was how to order. You walk in and get a ticket and then you're supposed to order at the counter. However it's confusing to know which counter to go to.Can't go wrong with corned beef or the pastrami sandwiches! It's expensive but they are delicious. The bread was fresh, meat was tender and we got to sit and relax to enjoy both. (We must have come during non rush hour)Is it the best deli in the world? I don't know...but worth the stop for a warm sandwich on a cold day with a side of nostalgia.\",\n",
       " 'Ran in last night for a quick bite.This hot dog that I heavy handedly squeezed ketchup and mustard on. Still great.',\n",
       " 'Preferred the corn beef over the pastrami. The potato knish is hot, soft, comforting, and the perfect type of bland. The mustard is God-like. I will be ordering bottles. It added an incredible burst of flavor to the sandwich and knish. It was as if everything in this deli was made for this mustard. Service - Rude, confusing, and disorderly on Friday 10AM.',\n",
       " \"Wow. That's the only word I need to describe the sandwich I ordered. The serving size is HUGE, and the pastrami literally fills up your entire stomach. It's both juicy and tender, a sandwich that genuinely changed my perspective on sandwiches. The interior was quite charming, having an 80s diner vibe. There were rows of tables free for sitting. The highlight was definitely the sandwich, but we also ordered a soup. It was decent. I don't think I would go back for any other casual meal, only because it is not the type of food I would usually get, but it is definitely worth checking out as a landmark of NYC and of Soho.\",\n",
       " \"Let's just say I couldn't feel my body after leaving this place. You can really feel the hustle and the bustle of people coming in to eat, getting their orders and sitting down to eat. The structure of the place confuses me because you need a ticket when you walk in, go to any open person to order your food, certain tables are for sitting down and certain tables are for ordering restaurant style. MAKE SURE TO HOLD ON TO YOUR TICKET. you cannot leave the premises without it. My group ordered the roast beef, corned beef and pastrami, the pastrami was hands down my favorite. The meat was moist and tender and pair it with the pickles and you get happiness. Don't miss out!\",\n",
       " \"Am I in the food heaven? It's so holy moly's terrific good!! Referral by a friend, he recommended I come here during my trip in NY and I did and I were so glad that I was here. The meat is so tender and delicious that I couldn't resist and finished my meal in a second. The ambiance is nice and you see a lot photo frames on the wall displaying the history, I like it. Hope I will have next NY trip soon in the future and come back to enjoy.\",\n",
       " \"I'd like to know where New Yorkers go for pastrami's. \\xa0When I was there, everyone looked like tourists. I have to believe New Yorkers don't pay $24 for a pastrami sandwich, no matter how good it is. \\xa0For me, it's a once and done. \\xa0The pastrami was very good. \\xa0But we have equally good pastrami at Langers back home. \\xa0And I don't experience \\xa0nearly the sticker shock, including $7 for a scoop of slaw. \\xa0And that outdated New York attitude I can do without. \\xa0Is that intentional for the tourists or do they just really don't give a F. \\xa0The only smile I got was from the cashier. \\xa0 Call me old fashion but a few smiles would be nice when I m shelling out $40 for a soup and sandwich with a side of slaw.\"]"

       "[\"I'm confident this will be better than you can imagine. You will see the ancient facade from the outside then walk into this old, nothing-fancy deli with an aged aesthetic, which all simply conveys their experience. At this point, you'll still be wondering what the hype is all about. Then you get your sandwich with generous portions and take the first bite. It will probably be perfect. The meat is ideal, exceptionally juicy and flavorful. A few bites later, when you start to get a little full, you'll realize that all the pictures of celebrities on the wall makes sense. This sandwich is pretty damn good.\",\n",
       " \"Oy vey, do I bother exercising my fingers to type this review since there's already 10K+ and it's an institution to all.... well here I go anyway:Was over the moon excited to try this classic spot, referenced in movies & tv shows galore. I'm a Jew, so the bar is set high when it comes to classic delicatessen. Katz was a disappointment to say the least. Very thickly sliced meats... I think it's safe to say most who eat sandwiches prefer it on the thinly sliced side. They used a butcher knife, no slicing machine in sight. I respect that. I ordered pastrami on rye with mustard and coleslaw. I have had MUCH tastier, saltier pastrami...for example Carnegie Deli (RIP) and the best, Harold's in NJ. Was a bit on the fatty side. Bread was not fresh, granted it was late. Matzo ball soup wasn't half bad--tasty broth, fluffy ball...obviously still not Grandma's. Half sour & sour pickles provided, no complaints. Decent sized portions but pretty dang pricy.Overall, the service at Katz was very rude (you say typical NYC charm, but I beg to differ). It's cafeteria order style late night, you get a ticket. To pay by credit card it is all the way in the back, cash up front only. Wall bombarded with celebrity photos who have visited. Old, dingy charm interior maintained. An OK meal, especially to those who don't eat Jew food often...but I personally would not make the trek to the village again for it.\",\n",
       " \"Everybody says that a trip to NY is not completed without a sandwich from Katz's. I dropped by the place in the morning of my last day. The place was lightly populated. There were many cutter stations, sandwiches in the front and bagels at the back, so I doubt there can be a long wait even during a busy time. Of course, I opted for the Pastrami Sandwich. Haven't had many Pastrami Sandwich, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. The ones that I've had were dry and hard to swallow. With the stacks of meat that were piled between the thin slices of bread and mustard, I expected Katz's Pastrami Sandwich to be the same. But, I couldn't be more wrong. The moment I tried to pick up the humongous sandwich, everything started to fall apart; everything was surprisingly soft. Even the bread was softer than I expected. Each slice of pastrami was accompanied with a good amount of fat that made the whole pile melt-in-the-mouth tender. Although the sandwich was big, it was easy to get a mouthful of everything. The pastrami tasted fresh, succulent, and not salty at all. Katz's Pastrami Sandwich gave me a Pastrami experience that I've never had before.The fresh and pickled cucumbers cut the meaty, fatty sandwich well. I also enjoyed ketchup on the sandwich. Despite its high quality, the sandwich was still a litte too pricey, in my opinion.By the end, I was completely and happily stuffed with one sandwich; I would recommend splitting between 2. I can concur that this is a must-visit classics spot for visitors of NYC.\",\n",
       " \"Whenever you're in NYC, one of the iconic food spots to visit is Katz. The place is always busy and the portion sizes are definitely worth the price. I ordered the pastrami hot sandwich and thank goodness I was able to share the sandwich with my wife. The sandwich was enormous!Each bite was full of flavor with each piece of meat being juicy and savory. There's nothing I can't stand more than a dry sandwich and this is anything but that. The experience was completed by washing it all down with Dr. Brown Cream Soda. The place might be a little too touristy for some, but the food is worth it in my opinion. Can't wait to go back and try the other sandwiches!\",\n",
       " \"So, I had zero interest in eating here on our honeymoon last October but Heather insisted. I just assumed this was an overrated tourist trap that happened to be featured in some movie I have never (nor ever will) see. But heather had ate here a few years back and raved about it, so being a good husband I obliged.We walked down from our condo in Midtown and I was further less impressed seeing the mass of humanity lined up down the street to get in (I really hate line ups). After a long wait in line outside we were given a ticket to join the cattle call inside, literally shoulder to shoulder people. I almost choked when I looked at the sandwich board and saw the pricing on sandwiches... all over $20 each. At that point I wished we had decided to dine anywhere but here.What this ended up being was the best damn meal we had on our New York adventure. Oh my lord, was I wrong. There is a reason people line up for this and pay crazy prices. As soon as I saw the first sandwiches being passed over the counter I knew I was wrong on my preconceived notions of this place. HUGE sandwiches stacked with delicious smelling meat that is pickled/ cured/ carved in house. \\xa0 We were very hungry and decided to tame our ordering a bit... we ordered a half corned beef, a full Reuben, a matzo ball soup and a side of pickles. I don't even know where to start on what was best... everything in front of us was incredible. We could not finish everything in front of us, try as I might.I would wait in this line up in a heartbeat in the future. Incredible.\",\n",
       " \"Katz's is probably the most famous deli in New York, if not the world.I've lived five minutes from here for almost three years but my first visit was last weekend. Somehow my desire for meat and willigness to wait in line never quite dovetail. But around 11 am on a Sunday the lines were mild and my boyfriend and I decided it was the day.Katz's is chaotic in a way it doesn't need to be. Confusingly, there's a small section for table service. There are at least three places to queue for food, though I believe only two of those serve sandwiches. The lines are self-forming and unpoliced, which leads to a lot of cutting.It took us maybe 20 minutes to get our sandwich, and that was with a negligible line compared to the hordes coming in when we left. Service is rushed and indifferent. Tables aren't very clean and if you get soup there'll be about as much on the plate as in the bowl.So, why go?The pastrami is truly all that. Thick cut, mildly smoky, moist, reminiscent of a pleasantly fatty brisket. Excellent. All it needs is that nice sharp mustard and a few bites of pickle. Absolutely worth the $22 split between two people.We also had a chocolate egg cream (unknown, at least $5) and matzoh ball soup ($8). The former is a great example, a bit creamier than typical. The latter is mostly broth and ball, but both are solid. It's massive so split this as well.After tax and tip, this somehow added up to $60. They're cash only and you pay with your ticket on the way out.Overall, the experience is stressful but it's worth doing at least once. I may look into delivery to get that meat without the hassle, but I know I'll be going back for it.\",\n",
       " \"Is it chaos? YESIs there a wait? YESIs it expensive? YES Is it worth it tho..? YESSSSSSSSSSSS Honestly, if its your first time please please try the pastrami.. i mean its what they're KNOWN for.. don't get me wrong.. I'm sure all the other sandwiches/items are good but its the same thing as going to a 5 star steak restaurant known for their dry aged steaks and ordering chicken.. i mean.. dont you want to rate the food on what they're good at and the reason why everybody is lining up for?! They offer the other menu items probably as a side so other people who don't like pastrami can have some bomb food but seriously tho.. COME ON. Maybe i'm being a little mean but if you get food.. it would make some sort of sense to you. I come from the home of Langers in Los Angeles.. which is OUR version of Katz (but i think Langers is better by a TAD (: ). Like all the other reviews.. get the REUBEN! You can easily share it so you don't get stuffed till you can't move! The main reason why I took off one star was bc of the overall cleanliness of the restaurant. They try to clean as much as possible which I get.. its crazy in there.. the space is SMALL. However, the floors are dirty and when we went the vents were leaking!! So it felt like getting rained on by dirty water :( . I didn't let that ruin my experience but it was definitely worth taking one star off.My boyfriend was a happy camper and it is definitely a place we would go back when we visit. We kind of like the chaos feel... feels very new york.\",\n",
       " \"WOW, this place is incredible. Is it a little pricey.....yes, but in my eyes, it's worth it. I've enjoyed it sober, I've enjoyed it drunk, but to truly appreciate all the flavor, you should eat while sober. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and the corned beef. The chicken salad sandwich was MASSIVE. I'm very picky about my chicken salad and this exceeded expectations. The sandwich had the perfect ratio of white chicken meat to mayo to celery. It was truly the perfect bite.Corned beef was also phenomenal. It had a tender, melt-in-your-mouth texture. The fat was still on it and just added to the deliciousness. I can't say enough great things about Katz's. I just wish I lived near it so I can experience it more. PRO TIP: You can ask for half sandwiches! If you're craving a couple of things, you can have your cake and eat it too.\",\n",
       " \"Have lived in New York for 5 years, and somehow never went into Katz's - probably always dissuaded by the chaos/lines. Go when its raining to avoid mayhem.Pastrami reuben. That's all you need to know.\",\n",
       " \"5 stars because hands down it's the best pastrami you will ever have. If you've never been please visit. You don't go for the service it is for the sheer love of the food. The steak fries, the pastrami, the hot dogs, the mustard, the rye bread, the pickles...oh I could go on!!!Be prepared to wait in line if it is the weekend and have people hover over you while you eat and they wait for a table. If you're local and just want the best pastrami and don't live close to Harold's which is a distant second go late at night to avoid the crowds and lines and just deal with those visiting after partying. They are now up to $23 for pastrami on rye and yes it's worth every red cent!\",\n",
       " \"Listen, this is very simple..:: if you don't mind spending $30 on a pastrami and Coke. Then we can talk. Don't try anything else... you will not be able to finish your sandwich! And people, I've tried many other things here .... just stay stay with the \\xa0pastrami, it is the best sandwich there ... period! Walk in grab a number, walk to the slicing station and ask for pastrami! It will be sliced in front of you and piled high! Take your sandwich and your drink sit in a table with pickles... yes they are a must... and don't be tempted by anything else. Once you have finished what you can eat, you can carry the rest to the last counter where they will wrap it for you. They are always wrapping, so don't be shy about it.Ps. Don't loose that little ticket that what you have to hand to the cashier in your way out to pay! :-)\",\n",
       " \"What else is there to be said?Everything here other than the pastrami is pretty average--but that pastrami is to die for. Soooo tasty and flavorful and just keeps you coming back for more. This is definitely a must visit in any trip to NYC, though don't go during rush hour to avoid massive lines.Egg cream was decent, but nothing special.Matzoh ball soup was decent, but nothing special.Knish was just not very good.Overall, come here and get the pastrami--it's worth the trip.\",\n",
       " 'One of the iconic deli restaurant in NYC since 1888. Upon entering the restaurant, you would receive a red ticket. We ordered pastrami, corn beef, potato Latke and matzo ball soup. Everything was good and we especially loved the pastrami sandwich, which had a combination of lean and fat meat. The pastrami was tender, fresh, savory, moist and enjoyable delicious. Corn beef was a little bit dry, but it was still good. I highly recommend to get the pastrami instead of the corn beef. The sandwiches were good size and it came along with pickles. There are lots of tables in the back near the bathroom. It is a little expensive and one sandwich costs about 24 dollars, but it is worth. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. It is great spot to get pastrami sandwich.',\n",
       " 'Katz\\'s deli - since 1888. And mostly unchanged since my childhood visits. So the line was a full block long! Fortunately, the weather was terrific for a mid-winter day, and we had a nice time chatting with those on line with us.When you enter, you get a ticket - and you cannot leave without one, so be careful! Your food and drink costs are handwritten on your ticket by the \"Cutter\" and drink station folks, and you can pay cash at the exit or credit in the back. Everything moves fairly quickly, so we were sitting down within 45 minutes of our arrival at the end of the line. Once in you head to your random \"Cutter\" sandwich station (seven choices) or to the hot dog/burger/knish/latke line, unless you want table service- on this day an estimated 1/2 hour wait.This was a first for my wife, so the wait was worth it for me to watch her sample the fresh sliced pastrami Cutter #5 placed on the counter as he prepared our pastrami on rye ($22.45), along with a generous helping of kosher dill pickles and a monstrous mound of cole slaw ($1.00). The oh my god was expected...We moved on from the sandwich line to open seating grabbing a black cherry and a coke on the way ($5.90) In summary the sandwich was magnificent- the best pastrami sandwich on earth, IMHO. Tipping your cutter is customary...so figure $75 all in for two at this venerable NYC deli. Put it on your bucket list.',\n",
       " \"I personally do not rally like this kind if sandwich, but I would have to say that it is a good place for late night food and hanging out with a group of friends. We went after 10:00pm, and it was still crowded that it took around 20 mins to us to finish ordering. The good thing is that we did not need to wait in the line outside. Note: *Make sure you keep your ticket because that's how you order and pay and leave the door. *Table is available for self server. *Water is available at the very back.\",\n",
       " \"I was excited to come here because of its popularity. It's cafeteria style so you enter and someone hands you a green ticket. Hold onto your ticket because if you lose it it's a $50 fee.In my opinion it was very unorganized. Different workers were telling us different things about where to stand and how to order so it took us a second to finally order. The cutter was very friendly and lets you try a piece of meat before making your sandwich. I ordered a corn beef sandwich on a hero and we also ordered pastrami sandwiches, carrot cake, bread pudding, and fries. The pastrami was the best! The corned beef I just thought was okay. I loved the desserts as well. They have a huge walk for tap water in the back.The main reason for my 4 stars is the price. It's about $22 for a sandwich which kind of shocked me. Overall I would come back though and order the pastrami again. Definitely the best pastrami sandwich I've tasted!\",\n",
       " \"Food: the pastrami was insanely yummy, not hard (corn beef was kinda chewy) but melts perfectly into your mouth with so much flavor.The portion is huge though, so even though I ordered half a sandwich, I could not handle all that meat. Was enough meat for like 4 sandwiches. The matzo ball was decent, tasted like flour. Prob would not get that again. Service: it was interesting, you walk in they give you a ticket. You go to where the cutters are, where they will give u sample and also make the sandwich for you. After you get your food, you sit down, finish, and THEN you pay with the ticket they gave you in the beginning. It was def an experience for me.I went on a Saturday 9:45am so there wasn't much of a wait which is why I went to try.Price was about $23 for half the sandwich and the soup. There are plenty of seats.\",\n",
       " \"Had to give this place a try after seeing all the videos and people mentioning Katz.Was not disappointed at all.Came here around 9pm on a weekday (Christmas week) and the queue was not long at all (Probably got lucky).I would have to say it was the best pastrami I've ever had. Nice and moist and just melts in yo mouth.Grab that Dr. Brown's soda while you're there\",\n",
       " \"Katz was on our list for our NY trip this past week. Luckily it was a short walk from our hotel. When you arrive to Katz, you're given a ticket per person. Keep this since you'll need it to pay on your way out. There are a few cutters so you can pick any line and any of them can serve you. The wait was maybe 10 mins or so in our line so it wasn't bad at all. While he's slicing your food, he gives samples of the meat for you to try!+ Pastrami Reuben Sandwich - 8/10 - this was pretty good. I got the half size and even that I couldn't finish. It was huge and they give you a good portion of meat. The sandwich will most likely fall apart while you're eating it. + Matzoball Soup - 8/10 - I got the cup size and it was the perfect portion. The matzoball was delicious and the broth was well seasoned. My only issue was that the soup was lukewarm and I wish it had been hot since it was a rainy NY night. + Corned Beef Sandwich - 10/10 - my fiancé's pick. I've never had corned beef but I tried some of his sandwich and it was delicious! He said it's one of the best he's had. They also give you a plate of pickles to eat. Seating is first come first but there's a ton of seating so you'll be able to find a spot pretty easily. Overall you can expect to pay between $25-30 a person. Definitely give Katz's a try!\",\n",
       " \"Ok, so I waited in line outside on a cool and drizzly day for lunch about 35 minutes before getting inside and waiting another 10 minutes before getting to the counter to order. Of course when entering I was given my ticket and instructed not to lose it. I ordered a 1/2 pastrami sandwich with a bowl of matzo ball soup for $19. The meat cutter who took my order marked my ticket with what I ordered so the ticket represents your bill that is paid when you leave. All of the table service area was full so I opted for counter service and after getting my food found an empty table to sit down at and eat. The sandwich was actually smaller than I expected but still was very good. Quality ingredients make for quality food and the pastrami, bread and soup were all yummy and filling. It was a very good meal. I consider this place to be a must stop if in Manhattan and easy to get to with a subway stop just a block away. When leaving you must present your ticket to pay and leave. If you are using a credit card you have to pay in the rear of the restaurant. With cash you pay up front near the entrance. The sign says lost tickets require a $50 fee so don't lose yours!P.S. If you only want water to drink they have a free water dispenser in the rear of the restaurant. Also, it's neat to walk,around and look at the pictures of all of the celebrities who have eaten here.\",\n",

This isn\\'t that no-nitrate Columbus deli roll stuff, this is highly seasoned, medium rare pink, crunchy bark and perfectly fatty brisket. Sliced just thin enough. Heavy on the mustard.

We ordered the pastrami sandwich with the mustard, as they have it on the menu. The height of the meat on the sandwich is impressive. They stack the pastrami making the sandwich huge. This makes it worth the $22. It is big enough to split the sandwich and only eat half, which is what we did. The pastrami is tender and full of flavor. The bread was fresh and soft. The Rye bread did not have the strong rye flavor which was great so that we could taste more of the pastrami with their house made mustard. We also ordered the square potato knish for $5. It was pretty good. We had the Katz Ale beer by Brooklyn Brewery. We had never seen the Katz Ale flavor and thought being at Katz would be the perfect time to drink it. It was decent.

A little more fatty than the corned beef sandwich which I got as well, so that gives it a little more flavor and a leg up over the corned beef. Matzo ball soup, superb. It's a huge ball so you could probably share it between two if you're getting sandwiches. Got sides of fries and coleslaw (yum) as well. Tables have ketchup and mustard. Mustard is good.

It\\'s large enough to share with a friend, if you don\\'t want your digestion to work overtime at the crack of dawn. Harry & Sally\\'s table is clearly marked, to the delight of my movie fanatic friend, who made sure to sit underneath the sign. Overall ok to do once, hopefully without the bouncer exchange at the end. I still say go to Sarge\\'s in Murray Hill all the way!',\n",
       " \"This is the best sandwich I've ever had. Not being dramatic. Get the Reuben sandwich with the pastrami. It is melt in your mouth good. Love the character & history of this place. The pickles & cucumbers are a great addition. Btw: the ticket system is kind of confusing if you have never been here. When you walk in everyone gets a blue ticket. This ticket is where your order is written on. You have to have one to exit, even if it is blank. If you try to exit without a ticket they will charge you $50.\"]"

Keep this since you'll need it to pay on your way out. There are a few cutters so you can pick any line and any of them can serve you. The wait was maybe 10 mins or so in our line so it wasn't bad at all. While he's slicing your food, he gives samples of the meat for you to try!+ Pastrami Reuben Sandwich - 8/10 - this was pretty good. I got the half size and even that I couldn't finish. It was huge and they give you a good portion of meat. The sandwich will most likely fall apart while you're eating it. + Matzoball Soup - 8/10 - I got the cup size and it was the perfect portion. The matzoball was delicious and the broth was well seasoned. My only issue was that the soup was lukewarm and I wish it had been hot since it was a rainy NY night. + Corned Beef Sandwich - 10/10 - my fiancé's pick. I've never had corned beef but I tried some of his sandwich and it was delicious! He said it's one of the best he's had. They also give you a plate of pickles to eat. Seating is first come first but there's a ton of seating so you'll be able to find a spot pretty easily. Overall you can expect to pay between $25-30 a person. Definitely give Katz's a try!\",\n",

Of course when entering I was given my ticket and instructed not to lose it. I ordered a 1/2 pastrami sandwich with a bowl of matzo ball soup for $19. The meat cutter who took my order marked my ticket with what I ordered so the ticket represents your bill that is paid when you leave. All of the table service area was full so I opted for counter service and after getting my food found an empty table to sit down at and eat. The sandwich was actually smaller than I expected but still was very good. Quality ingredients make for quality food and the pastrami, bread and soup were all yummy and filling. It was a very good meal. I consider this place to be a must stop if in Manhattan and easy to get to with a subway stop just a block away. When leaving you must present your ticket to pay and leave. If you are using a credit card you have to pay in the rear of the restaurant. With cash you pay up front near the entrance. The sign says lost tickets require a $50 fee so don't lose yours!P.S.

       " 'Go to Sarge\\'s on 36th/3rd Ave for a hefty pastrami sandwich and quintessential NYC experience! They put the deli in delicious, not Katz\\'s.After hanging out in the LES, Katz\\'s pastrami sandwich and a cream soda sounded like a winning combo at 4am. However, expect some attitude on the side, especially by the bouncer harassing people for tickets when they leave. A great way to swindle more money from unassuming late-night patrons, who are not paying attention to a raffle ticket handed to them at the beginning of the meal. I misplaced mine briefly, and they were not going to let me exit. I did find it stuffed in one of my pockets, but their attitude was \"Find it....or else\".The pastrami sandwich itself is fine, if a bit fatty and hardly 1-lb like they advertise. It\\'s large enough to share with a friend, if you don\\'t want your digestion to work overtime at the crack of dawn. Harry & Sally\\'s table is clearly marked, to the delight of my movie fanatic friend, who made sure to sit underneath the sign. Overall ok to do once, hopefully without the bouncer exchange at the end. I still say go to Sarge\\'s in Murray Hill all the way!',\n",
       " \"I kinda cheated going here... It was definitely on my list for the trip so even though we didn't have time to eat at Katz, we decided to buy a pastrami sandwich to go, and eat it on the plane ride home.Since I knew I wouldn't get to eat the sandwich until a couple of hours, I did sneak a quick bite to try it while it was hot. \\xa0It was excellent. \\xa0The mustard is fabulous.Some 4/5 hours later, I ate the rest of the sandwich. \\xa0I have to admit, even cold, it was fantastic. \\xa0The pickles are a nice touch.\",\n",
       " 'When it comes to deli sandwiches, I love thick-cut pastrami, and that is what Katz\\'s is known for. It is definitely popular with tourists and for me, I tried it, it was OK and I probably won\\'t be back again. My bf and I ordered a half sandwich-pastrami-and half soup-matzo ball-to share. Frankly, I\\'ve just had much better pastrami elsewhere, even in small neighborhood deli\\'s back home. The meat lacking that smokey flavor, which in my opinion, is essential for pastrami. The matzo ball soup is just OK as well. It tasted the same as if I was going to dissolve a soup packet in hot water. Also, the butchers here either really hate their jobs or they are just plain rude. I understand some people really dislike tourists, but if you applied to work at Katz\\'s then you\\'re kind of asking for it? When there is a clear line in front you, it\\'s not ok to pick out \"locals\" and Spanish-speaking customers to go to the front and order. It\\'s one thing to give me attitude and another to not honor my place in line.',\n",
       " 'Visited New York and of course had to check out the famous Katz Deli. We came later in the night right before they closed - it wasn\\'t too busy and we got right in. The cutter mentioned it\\'s usually packed from right before lunch to just after the dinner rush, so if you go during that time, be prepared to wait. The pastrami lived up to the hype and was the best pastrami I\\'ve ever had. It was both tender and flavorful. Enough about that, here\\'s how it works. As you walk through the door, you\\'re going to be handed a ticket for each person in your party. HANG ON TO THIS TICKET. It\\'s where they mark what you order and know how much to charge you after you\\'re done eating. If you lose the ticket, it\\'s a $50 charge. Once you have your ticket, walk up to the counter and there are several hanging signs above (cutter #1, cutter #2, etc.). Get in line for a cutter - each cutter has a separate line. We were confused at first and a worker told us to \"order in the front\" so we got in line at the front, but it was a line for the deli to order hotdogs and others. If you want a sandwich get inline for a cutter. The cutter will take your sandwich orders (pastrami, corned beef, etc.). They\\'ll let you taste a piece of the meat before you order to make sure you like it. Fountain drinks are in another line at the end of the counter. And so are sides such as fries, bottled drinks, etc. There\\'s also 2 separate cashiers depending on what method of payment you choose - cash is at the front of the store by the door and card at the end of the counter where you get the bottled drinks.',\n",
       " \"Came here for a quick snack at around 5pm. This was on our list of places to go to New York months ago.You line up and tell the carver what you want. We ordered a half pastrami with coleslaw and matzo ball soup. You pay on the way out so don't lose your ticket.The place is huge - when we were there tables were available but I guess the size goes to show that it could get packed at different times.The pastrami sandwich is good. It was also my first time eating matzo ball soup, which was ok for me.Overall I think the place is good but I also think that it's a bit overhyped.\",\n",
       " \"Why can't I give this place 6 stars or even 7?! This place is literally the embodiment of what a sandwich should taste like. If God goes down from the heavens to eat a sandwich, I am 110% sure he or she would eat here. This deli joint feels like a DMV from the inside with Disneyland lines from outside to their order counters. The employees are the best as well because they give this place that NYC feel, hardworking, tough looking, but very helpful. They have collection of pictures of famous people on all of their walls and that is a sight to behold. Anyway.. \\xa0leggo on the food shall we...I ordered their Pastrami sandwich, which is melt in your mouth.Their sandwich is simple; a meat (which is pastrami for me) and a rye bread. Their meat feels like butter when you're eating it. I am actually having foodgasm by just describing it. Their rye bread is thick enough to hold that juicy, meaty goodness, not to mention it is best the best dough in the business, as well. My girlfriend ordered their Corned Beef, which we shared half and half. This, too have the same quality as the Pastrami, so you can nevet go wrong ordering what. For the our refreshments, we ordered their Egg Cream shake. So good, taste like a way better version of an eggnog. It is the right drink to compliment the best sandwich I ever had. Yes, I said it! No doubt about it! Overall, if I get bored, I would go to NYC for a day just to eat here.. that's how I love this place :)PS: Hey why is my picture not on those walls?! I am famous being yelp elite lolPSS: I can only dream haha\",\n",
       " \"Sandwiches SO good. Didn't know what to expect as I made the line on a Saturday. Lots of tourists making their patronages. But it was worth it. Wait wasn't too long even though we were wrapped around the side of the building. They hand you a ticket as you walk in (for each person). DO NOT LOSE IT. If you do they assume you got two sandwiches and two sodas which is around $50. You head to whichever cut station has the shortest line when you get in. Tip: go in to the cut station furthest from the door, generally the shortest line. You pick your meat and they give you a plate with some small slices to taste to let them know you like it.Their pastrami is what they're known for (from Instagram) and it is SO delicious. A little more fatty than the corned beef sandwich which I got as well, so that gives it a little more flavor and a leg up over the corned beef. Matzo ball soup, superb. It's a huge ball so you could probably share it between two if you're getting sandwiches. Got sides of fries and coleslaw (yum) as well. Tables have ketchup and mustard. Mustard is good. Add extra to your sandwiches. If you're paying with credit card, go to the counter beyond the cut stations.\",\n",
       " \"When in NYC I heard eating at Katz is a must. As a tourist visiting the city, I quickly realised the area around the deli isn't the best espeically when traveling by subway. However the food inside is everything you dream of. Juicy meat sandwiches cut off a hunk of meat right in front of you. The employee behind the counter even gave us a sample before slicing it up. Employees wear white triangular hats and the restaurant has memorabilia all over it. This place has an old fashion nostalgic feel to it. \\xa0Sandwiches run about $20. I ordered a patatoe kanish for $5 and a chocolate egg cream for $6. Everything was delicious (between the ambiance and the food) I couldn't had been happier. Although my pastrami sandwich was quite juicy with fat drippings. I ended up waking up in the middle of the night feeling like I had consumed a large quantity of hot grease. It was nothing two Pepto tablets couldn't take care of though.\",\n",
       " 'Had to eat here cause When Harry met Sally restaurant scene was filmed here. Had to try Rueben sandwich. Absolutely delicious! . Very crowded Worth the wait though!!',\n",
       " \"Been to NYC a few times and this was our first time trying Katz. They get incredibly busy but if you go off peak hours the wait isn't too bad and it's not too hard to find a table.We got their famous pastrami sandwich and although it was good, it was not as juicy as I had hoped and really needed the mustard otherwise it felt a bit dry. For $22 usd I expected better. Maybe we went on an off day. Schwartz in Montreal was much more melt in your mouth. Glad we tried it but wouldn't need to go back.\",\n",
       " \"There is one in Houston where I live. I have always wanted to go to the original one in New York. \\xa0We got that chance today it was an interesting experience.When you walk in they give you a ticket even if you aren't eating. \\xa0That's how they keep track of people and keep them from trying anything sneaky because you have to provide the ticket when you leave and use it to pay. \\xa0We opted to go to the counter and order directly from the chefs. \\xa0We got the pastrami on rye cuz you just have too. \\xa0It came with a pickle and a slightly pickled cucumber. \\xa0I must say it was quite good. \\xa0I added their mustard and it it spiced it up even more. \\xa0It had a great Smokey salty flavor and they pile the meat pretty high.I'm glad I was able to take this off my bucket list and they did not disappoint.\",\n",
       " 'When I first saw the lineup, I was immediately turned off. I hate lines and went onto my phone to ask people if they thought the wait would be worth it. With a resounding \"YES!\" that they all unanimously replied with, so I stood in line and waited. Surprisingly, the wait was quick and I was inside within 15 minutes. They give you a ticket to pay and exit with, even if you don\\'t purchase anything - it\\'s how they ensure everyone has paid in the end. After entering, I was given the option to line up with cutters and I hopped in line. As soon as it was my turn, I ordered the pastrami and my cutter put a slice on a plate for me to try. I stared at it, confused, so he actually had to instruct me to \"EAT. TRY.\" I carefully ate it with my non-sanitized hands (didn\\'t love that) but I really enjoyed the pastrami and happily accepted. The sandwich itself is expensive. It bothered me that it was a wait to find out it was $24USD for the sandwich (my own fault for not researching) but it was quite large and I found the taste and quality to be very much worth it. Also - if you\\'re paying by card, make sure you have your ID with you! I happened to have lost my wallet on the trip (ugh) and had a bit of trouble with it...',\n",
       " \"Of course insane pastrami sandwhich and fries.Place was packed. CEL RAY SODA!!!! Can't find this alot anywhere so of course I ordered two to start with. The pastrami came ten minutes later hot and on rye. Just out of this world. Never been refrigerated. Like braised meat consistency and texture. Deli mustard nice and spicy of course has to be added to the bread. Just a fantastic experience.\",\n",
       " \"Seriously, this is the best pastrami sandwich I have ever had in my life, hands down! The meat was so tender and juicy and ever so perfectly seasoned and grilled, oh my mouth is watering just thinking about it..Few tips:- Beware!! Price for one sandwich is $25 and they only accept cash in the front. Prices add up, so be careful what you order there. - Don't bother with the corn beef, so straight for the pastrami.- Don't loose your orange ticket! They will charge you 50 bucks if you loose it! - Sample the meats! You might go in thinking you want one thing, and leaving with another. That's what happened to me with the corn beef vs pastrami. - Lastly, it might be expensive, but it's so worth it! Definitely try it out.\",\n",
       " 'Sandwiches are crazy expensive.I live in NYC so I had to go & mark it off my list.I dont know how on earth the line system works inside & probably will never know. & yes the meat was very tender, juicy, wonderful. No, I wont go again. Just go once, enjoy the old school mrs.maisel type feel & sandwiches & tell your friends & family about it.',\n",
       " 'I LOVE this place. So much. The pastrami is to die for. Melts in your mouth like butter. My only negative is the pricing. Spent $39 tonight on just a pastrami sandwich and a side of potato salad. But I would do it over and over agin.',\n",
       " \"This is a NYC bucket list destination, and it's also good as hell. When I went there, I was initially overwhelmed with the restaurant system; when you enter, they give you a ticket, and when you leave, you give them back that ticket.I ordered a pastrami sandwich; they give you slices to sample, and it was perfect. I knew I was going to have an enjoyable gustatory experience. The pastrami was perfectly warm, and the mustard was perfect. It was the best pastrami sandwich I have had in my life! They also sell these craft sodas, and the diet cherry coke doesn't even taste like diet!I'm not going to lie, the sandwich is a bit pricey ($21.95!), so it's not a place I will be frequenting OFTEN, but it is a place that I need to go to once every 2 months.\",\n",
       " \"Is $21.45 for a pastrami sandwich worth? YES!After seeing the amount of reviews this place had and how expensive a typical sandwich can cost, I had doubts about this place! Ugh, I was totally wrong. This pastrami sandwich was the best I have ever tasted. Literally. The texture of the meat was just so juicy and plain, how can that sound so tasteful right? The serving was a good sharing portion if you aren't too hungry. They also serve pickles and cucumbers on the side to go with your sandwich.This place left me missing New York ;(\",\n",
       " \"This is quintessential NYC. be prepared to wait! \\xa0Suggestions1. \\xa0Split a sandwich-they are HUGE (seriously like over a pound of meat on each!) Avg $32/sandwich2. \\xa0Seat yourself and order at counter - this takes less time and is part of the experience3. \\xa0Drink water - sodas are like $44. \\xa0Don't go during regular mealtimes - line can be around the block5.
