The wait was maybe 10 mins or so in our line so it wasn't bad at all. While he's slicing your food, he gives samples of the meat for you to try!+ Pastrami Reuben Sandwich - 8/10 - this was pretty good. I got the half size and even that I couldn't finish. It was huge and they give you a good portion of meat. The sandwich will most likely fall apart while you're eating it. + Matzoball Soup - 8/10 - I got the cup size and it was the perfect portion. The matzoball was delicious and the broth was well seasoned. My only issue was that the soup was lukewarm and I wish it had been hot since it was a rainy NY night. + Corned Beef Sandwich - 10/10 - my fianc√©'s pick. I've never had corned beef but I tried some of his sandwich and it was delicious! He said it's one of the best he's had. They also give you a plate of pickles to eat.

All of the table service area was full so I opted for counter service and after getting my food found an empty table to sit down at and eat. The sandwich was actually smaller than I expected but still was very good. Quality ingredients make for quality food and the pastrami, bread and soup were all yummy and filling. It was a very good meal. I consider this place to be a must stop if in Manhattan and easy to get to with a subway stop just a block away. When leaving you must present your ticket to pay and leave. If you are using a credit card you have to pay in the rear of the restaurant. With cash you pay up front near the entrance. The sign says lost tickets require a $50 fee so don't lose yours!P.S.

I'll just add to the rest of the reviews and I felt this was just another tourist trap. It's not. Do yourself a favor, embrace the line and you will get to taste one of the best pieces of meat you'll ever have in your life. My husband and I would up there at like 2 am. There was a short line when we got there, and we got a ticket at the door. The guy who cut my meat was very nice and answered all of my questions about the menu thoroughly and without judgement and I really appreciated it. The meat was well seasoned and cooked perfectly.

       " 'I was crazy overwhelmed the second I walked into this place. I had no idea of the rules or the way that Katz\\'s is run so I was just confused. I\\'m still not sure how it works.We got in line at a \"cutter\" but let\\'s be real - it is chaos, people running into me, trying to cut in line, etc. You kind of have to shove other people to get to the front of the counter.For some odd reason that I still don\\'t know the answer to, is that the \"cutters\" give you slices of the meat to try first before they make your sandwich. I\\'m ordering the sandwich anyway, why do I need to try some slices ahead of time and just get full off of those? But we had a corned beef sandwich and a pastrami sandwich. I hated the corned beef but the pastrami was very good, it melted in your mouth. WAY too much mustard on the sandwiches though. I also don\\'t like pickles but we tried the pickles it came with and hated them both.My biggest problem here besides the complete madhouse inside, is how freakin\\' expensive the sandwiches are here! We only got 2 sandwiches and paid more than FORTY DOLLARS. How ridiculous. The sandwiches are overFLOWING with meat, so much that a human could not eat an entire sandwich. So if you just give us a normal amount of meat, you don\\'t have to charge $25 a sandwich.Overall, the pastrami sandwich was good but it\\'s certainly not worth the price.',\n",
       " 'I\\'ll admit, I watched Youtube tutorial before I even set foot in this joint and I still made a faux-pas (I went to the beverage line to order a chocolate egg cream when you\\'re supposed to order them in the grill line). But, the staff couldn\\'t have been more courteous, I don\\'t know why they get a bad wrap, and I just took it in stride. It was my first time having an egg cream. First time having a knish. First time having proper pastrami, it was so rich! I started to pick at the tender and highly seasoned meat and before I knew it, I was full! I hadn\\'t even gotten to the bread. This isn\\'t that no-nitrate Columbus deli roll stuff, this is highly seasoned, medium rare pink, crunchy bark and perfectly fatty brisket. Sliced just thin enough. Heavy on the mustard. I thought the knish would be ultra doughy, but the exterior was a crispy shell hiding mashed potatoes inside. The chocolate egg cream was good, like a carbonated chocolate milk, but it was lukewarm and needed ice!I ate in the back section where the staff were taking their bread (is that cornmeal on the floor?) and as I was packing up my sandwich in some parchment from my tray, two people asked me, \"you want a bag, love?\" And they brought me one. So nice. When I bought a t-shirt for my mom, I used my credit card. They gave me the shirt, I went back to the beverages line and paid and then left.Everyone says Katz a really touristy thing to do, but the thing is...is there another place like Katz left anywhere else? Jake Dell is doing a great job at being the umpteenth (in reality I think it\\'s 4) generation to keep this going!',\n",
       " \"So we used to like to visit the Carnegie Deli when in New York, but after that closed someone told us about Katz's, and it did not disappoint.Here is what we noticed:- We arrived around 10:30am and were handed a ticket...it wasn't very clear how things worked, but we wanted a sit-down lunch and so we were directed to one of the tables along the wall. \\xa0Just be sure to bring back all of the tickets you receive to the register when leaving, or apparently you get charged for lost tickets.- Service was ok...it took our waiter a little bit of time to show up and he was a little crusty as first, but he warmed up over time. \\xa0(Note, he made it clear that we should leave the tip in cash on the table versus putting it in the jar up front).- The foot was great. \\xa0Coffee was better than expected. \\xa0We got one pastrami sandwich and the bagel and lox platter. \\xa0They were out of sesame seed bagels, but the poppy seed one was pretty good.Bottom line: \\xa0Worth a visit, but try to go at a time where you can avoid the crowds!\",\n",

You walk in and get a ticket and then you're supposed to order at the counter. However it's confusing to know which counter to go to.Can't go wrong with corned beef or the pastrami sandwiches! It's expensive but they are delicious. The bread was fresh, meat was tender and we got to sit and relax to enjoy both. (We must have come during non rush hour)Is it the best deli in the world? I don't know...but worth the stop for a warm sandwich on a cold day with a side of nostalgia.\",\n",

It added an incredible burst of flavor to the sandwich and knish. It was as if everything in this deli was made for this mustard. Service - Rude, confusing, and disorderly on Friday 10AM.',\n",
       " \"Wow. That's the only word I need to describe the sandwich I ordered. The serving size is HUGE, and the pastrami literally fills up your entire stomach. It's both juicy and tender, a sandwich that genuinely changed my perspective on sandwiches. The interior was quite charming, having an 80s diner vibe. There were rows of tables free for sitting. The highlight was definitely the sandwich, but we also ordered a soup. It was decent. I don't think I would go back for any other casual meal, only because it is not the type of food I would usually get, but it is definitely worth checking out as a landmark of NYC and of Soho.\",\n",
       " \"Let's just say I couldn't feel my body after leaving this place. You can really feel the hustle and the bustle of people coming in to eat, getting their orders and sitting down to eat. The structure of the place confuses me because you need a ticket when you walk in, go to any open person to order your food, certain tables are for sitting down and certain tables are for ordering restaurant style. MAKE SURE TO HOLD ON TO YOUR TICKET. you cannot leave the premises without it. My group ordered the roast beef, corned beef and pastrami, the pastrami was hands down my favorite. The meat was moist and tender and pair it with the pickles and you get happiness. Don't miss out!\",\n",
       " \"Am I in the food heaven? It's so holy moly's terrific good!! Referral by a friend, he recommended I come here during my trip in NY and I did and I were so glad that I was here. The meat is so tender and delicious that I couldn't resist and finished my meal in a second. The ambiance is nice and you see a lot photo frames on the wall displaying the history, I like it. Hope I will have next NY trip soon in the future and come back to enjoy.\",\n",

Keep this since you'll need it to pay on your way out. There are a few cutters so you can pick any line and any of them can serve you. The wait was maybe 10 mins or so in our line so it wasn't bad at all. While he's slicing your food, he gives samples of the meat for you to try!+ Pastrami Reuben Sandwich - 8/10 - this was pretty good. I got the half size and even that I couldn't finish. It was huge and they give you a good portion of meat. The sandwich will most likely fall apart while you're eating it. + Matzoball Soup - 8/10 - I got the cup size and it was the perfect portion. The matzoball was delicious and the broth was well seasoned. My only issue was that the soup was lukewarm and I wish it had been hot since it was a rainy NY night. + Corned Beef Sandwich - 10/10 - my fianc√©'s pick. I've never had corned beef but I tried some of his sandwich and it was delicious! He said it's one of the best he's had. They also give you a plate of pickles to eat.

Of course when entering I was given my ticket and instructed not to lose it. I ordered a 1/2 pastrami sandwich with a bowl of matzo ball soup for $19. The meat cutter who took my order marked my ticket with what I ordered so the ticket represents your bill that is paid when you leave. All of the table service area was full so I opted for counter service and after getting my food found an empty table to sit down at and eat. The sandwich was actually smaller than I expected but still was very good. Quality ingredients make for quality food and the pastrami, bread and soup were all yummy and filling. It was a very good meal. I consider this place to be a must stop if in Manhattan and easy to get to with a subway stop just a block away. When leaving you must present your ticket to pay and leave. If you are using a credit card you have to pay in the rear of the restaurant. With cash you pay up front near the entrance. The sign says lost tickets require a $50 fee so don't lose yours!P.S. If you only want water to drink they have a free water dispenser in the rear of the restaurant. Also, it's neat to walk,around and look at the pictures of all of the celebrities who have eaten here.\",\n",

As you walk through the door, you\\'re going to be handed a ticket for each person in your party. HANG ON TO THIS TICKET. It\\'s where they mark what you order and know how much to charge you after you\\'re done eating. If you lose the ticket, it\\'s a $50 charge.

If you want a sandwich get inline for a cutter. The cutter will take your sandwich orders (pastrami, corned beef, etc.). They\\'ll let you taste a piece of the meat before you order to make sure you like it. Fountain drinks are in another line at the end of the counter.

Their rye bread is thick enough to hold that juicy, meaty goodness, not to mention it is best the best dough in the business, as well. My girlfriend ordered their Corned Beef, which we shared half and half. This, too have the same quality as the Pastrami, so you can nevet go wrong ordering what.

Wait wasn't too long even though we were wrapped around the side of the building. They hand you a ticket as you walk in (for each person). DO NOT LOSE IT. If you do they assume you got two sandwiches and two sodas which is around $50. You head to whichever cut station has the shortest line when you get in. Tip: go in to the cut station furthest from the door, generally the shortest line. You pick your meat and they give you a plate with some small slices to taste to let them know you like it.Their pastrami is what they're known for (from Instagram) and it is SO delicious. A little more fatty than the corned beef sandwich which I got as well, so that gives it a little more flavor and a leg up over the corned beef. Matzo ball soup, superb. It's a huge ball so you could probably share it between two if you're getting sandwiches. Got sides of fries and coleslaw (yum) as well. Tables have ketchup and mustard. Mustard is good.

       " \"When in NYC I heard eating at Katz is a must. As a tourist visiting the city, I quickly realised the area around the deli isn't the best espeically when traveling by subway. However the food inside is everything you dream of. Juicy meat sandwiches cut off a hunk of meat right in front of you. The employee behind the counter even gave us a sample before slicing it up. Employees wear white triangular hats and the restaurant has memorabilia all over it. This place has an old fashion nostalgic feel to it. \\xa0Sandwiches run about $20. I ordered a patatoe kanish for $5 and a chocolate egg cream for $6. Everything was delicious (between the ambiance and the food) I couldn't had been happier. Although my pastrami sandwich was quite juicy with fat drippings. I ended up waking up in the middle of the night feeling like I had consumed a large quantity of hot grease. It was nothing two Pepto tablets couldn't take care of though.\",\n",
       " 'Had to eat here cause When Harry met Sally restaurant scene was filmed here. Had to try Rueben sandwich. Absolutely delicious! . Very crowded Worth the wait though!!',\n",
       " \"Been to NYC a few times and this was our first time trying Katz. They get incredibly busy but if you go off peak hours the wait isn't too bad and it's not too hard to find a table.We got their famous pastrami sandwich and although it was good, it was not as juicy as I had hoped and really needed the mustard otherwise it felt a bit dry. For $22 usd I expected better. Maybe we went on an off day. Schwartz in Montreal was much more melt in your mouth. Glad we tried it but wouldn't need to go back.\",\n",
       " \"There is one in Houston where I live. I have always wanted to go to the original one in New York. \\xa0We got that chance today it was an interesting experience.When you walk in they give you a ticket even if you aren't eating. \\xa0That's how they keep track of people and keep them from trying anything sneaky because you have to provide the ticket when you leave and use it to pay. \\xa0We opted to go to the counter and order directly from the chefs. \\xa0We got the pastrami on rye cuz you just have too. \\xa0It came with a pickle and a slightly pickled cucumber. \\xa0I must say it was quite good. \\xa0I added their mustard and it it spiced it up even more. \\xa0It had a great Smokey salty flavor and they pile the meat pretty high.I'm glad I was able to take this off my bucket list and they did not disappoint.\",\n",
       " 'When I first saw the lineup, I was immediately turned off. I hate lines and went onto my phone to ask people if they thought the wait would be worth it. With a resounding \"YES!\" that they all unanimously replied with, so I stood in line and waited. Surprisingly, the wait was quick and I was inside within 15 minutes. They give you a ticket to pay and exit with, even if you don\\'t purchase anything - it\\'s how they ensure everyone has paid in the end. After entering, I was given the option to line up with cutters and I hopped in line. As soon as it was my turn, I ordered the pastrami and my cutter put a slice on a plate for me to try. I stared at it, confused, so he actually had to instruct me to \"EAT. TRY.\" I carefully ate it with my non-sanitized hands (didn\\'t love that) but I really enjoyed the pastrami and happily accepted. The sandwich itself is expensive. It bothered me that it was a wait to find out it was $24USD for the sandwich (my own fault for not researching) but it was quite large and I found the taste and quality to be very much worth it. Also - if you\\'re paying by card, make sure you have your ID with you! I happened to have lost my wallet on the trip (ugh) and had a bit of trouble with it...',\n",
       " \"Of course insane pastrami sandwhich and fries.Place was packed. CEL RAY SODA!!!! Can't find this alot anywhere so of course I ordered two to start with. The pastrami came ten minutes later hot and on rye. Just out of this world. Never been refrigerated. Like braised meat consistency and texture. Deli mustard nice and spicy of course has to be added to the bread. Just a fantastic experience.\",\n",
       " \"Seriously, this is the best pastrami sandwich I have ever had in my life, hands down! The meat was so tender and juicy and ever so perfectly seasoned and grilled, oh my mouth is watering just thinking about it..Few tips:- Beware!! Price for one sandwich is $25 and they only accept cash in the front. Prices add up, so be careful what you order there. - Don't bother with the corn beef, so straight for the pastrami.- Don't loose your orange ticket! They will charge you 50 bucks if you loose it! - Sample the meats! You might go in thinking you want one thing, and leaving with another. That's what happened to me with the corn beef vs pastrami. - Lastly, it might be expensive, but it's so worth it! Definitely try it out.\",\n",
       " 'Sandwiches are crazy expensive.I live in NYC so I had to go & mark it off my list.I dont know how on earth the line system works inside & probably will never know. & yes the meat was very tender, juicy, wonderful. No, I wont go again. Just go once, enjoy the old school mrs.maisel type feel & sandwiches & tell your friends & family about it.',\n",
       " 'I LOVE this place. So much. The pastrami is to die for. Melts in your mouth like butter. My only negative is the pricing. Spent $39 tonight on just a pastrami sandwich and a side of potato salad. But I would do it over and over agin.',\n",
       " \"This is a NYC bucket list destination, and it's also good as hell. When I went there, I was initially overwhelmed with the restaurant system; when you enter, they give you a ticket, and when you leave, you give them back that ticket.I ordered a pastrami sandwich; they give you slices to sample, and it was perfect. I knew I was going to have an enjoyable gustatory experience. The pastrami was perfectly warm, and the mustard was perfect. It was the best pastrami sandwich I have had in my life! They also sell these craft sodas, and the diet cherry coke doesn't even taste like diet!I'm not going to lie, the sandwich is a bit pricey ($21.95!), so it's not a place I will be frequenting OFTEN, but it is a place that I need to go to once every 2 months.\",\n",
       " \"Is $21.45 for a pastrami sandwich worth? YES!After seeing the amount of reviews this place had and how expensive a typical sandwich can cost, I had doubts about this place! Ugh, I was totally wrong. This pastrami sandwich was the best I have ever tasted. Literally. The texture of the meat was just so juicy and plain, how can that sound so tasteful right? The serving was a good sharing portion if you aren't too hungry. They also serve pickles and cucumbers on the side to go with your sandwich.This place left me missing New York ;(\",\n",
       " \"This is quintessential NYC. be prepared to wait! \\xa0Suggestions1. \\xa0Split a sandwich-they are HUGE (seriously like over a pound of meat on each!) Avg $32/sandwich2. \\xa0Seat yourself and order at counter - this takes less time and is part of the experience3. \\xa0Drink water - sodas are like $44. \\xa0Don't go during regular mealtimes - line can be around the block5. Enjoy it for the experience!\",\n",
       " \"This is the best sandwich I've ever had. Not being dramatic. Get the Reuben sandwich with the pastrami. It is melt in your mouth good. Love the character & history of this place. The pickles & cucumbers are a great addition. Btw: the ticket system is kind of confusing if you have never been here. When you walk in everyone gets a blue ticket. This ticket is where your order is written on. You have to have one to exit, even if it is blank. If you try to exit without a ticket they will charge you $50.\",\n",
       " 'Go to Sarge\\'s on 36th/3rd Ave for a hefty pastrami sandwich and quintessential NYC experience! They put the deli in delicious, not Katz\\'s.After hanging out in the LES, Katz\\'s pastrami sandwich and a cream soda sounded like a winning combo at 4am. However, expect some attitude on the side, especially by the bouncer harassing people for tickets when they leave. A great way to swindle more money from unassuming late-night patrons, who are not paying attention to a raffle ticket handed to them at the beginning of the meal. I misplaced mine briefly, and they were not going to let me exit. I did find it stuffed in one of my pockets, but their attitude was \"Find it....or else\".The pastrami sandwich itself is fine, if a bit fatty and hardly 1-lb like they advertise. It\\'s large enough to share with a friend, if you don\\'t want your digestion to work overtime at the crack of dawn. Harry & Sally\\'s table is clearly marked, to the delight of my movie fanatic friend, who made sure to sit underneath the sign. Overall ok to do once, hopefully without the bouncer exchange at the end. I still say go to Sarge\\'s in Murray Hill all the way!']"
